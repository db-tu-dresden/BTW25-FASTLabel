# FASTLabel

This repository contains the code used in FASTlabel, a labeling algorithm to fix the existing maintenance gap between 
supervised hinting models like FASTgres [^4] and reinforcement learning approaches like BAO [^1]. 

This code basis also contains updated functionalities of FASTgres and is still in development.
